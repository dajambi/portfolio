                            <p>
                            I've designed the main parts of Gordic's support and learning portal that included the three main pillars— legislative updates, methodic and best practices. I've delivered the responsive design with all interactions for the tablet and mobile and the design for the email newsletter.                                 <a href="https://www.gordic.cz/podpora/metodika" class="link odkaz">See it live</a>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="rf_paragraph">
                            <h2>Impact</h2>
                            <p>
                            Would you feel better if you had to work in a complex environment, but the software company would giving you learning materials, training videos & tutorials, legislative alerts, and best practices? This new part of Gordic's service helped to improve customer satisfaction and customer retention. Unfortunately, I am not able to prove it by any KPI. As the contractor, I didn't have long-term ownership of this project.

                        <p>
                        When I was working on the main Gordic web redesign, I've discovered via analytics a user needs to visit the support page. They wanted to get the law updates and they were actively seeking the best practices. When I highlighted this trend, the leaders of the company told me that they would like to solve this problem in the future. After some time the project manager called me and asked If I would help them design a new Support & learning port. We had a good relationship and I knew enough about the products and company. Naturally, I liked the idea that I can actually solve the problem that I've discovered.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Gordic had a highly educated team dedicated to establishing the process best-practices. Everything was is connected to law is quite complex. We had to structure the portal in a way that would represent the real world, but somehow simplify it to make it usable.</li>
                            <li>The second challenge was that the Visual design should be delivered by the external company and they had a delay. I had to find a way how to deliver it even though we were blocked by them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Identifying problems</h2>
                        <p>
                        Initially we had discussion what are the most frequent problems, what people often asks or what people don't understand on expert trainings, what is confusing on the legislative, where people are making the mistakes, what is causing the biggest pains in the industry. We gathered the data from the emails, feedback from trainings and expert knowledge of dedicated team. Based on that we together came up with the structure proposal.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        I went through some existing web to find out how they present the information, and how the legislativ is actually structured and how the changes are presented to public. For this kind of project is important to adopt the know habits (Jakob’s Law) of the target audience. The bold changes could caused more issues than benefits. I've took the layout inspiration from other Gordic webs with similar content and from Czech and European union institution.

                        <p>
                        We didn't have a much time, I convinced the team to go in small-weekly iterations. This approached has proved it's worth in the previous project, so I've designed in the same way. I started with homepage to demonstrate the structure and then go the details. I've planned the review every week in the early morning before my normal job. First two iteration I've done in mid level fidelity.
                        Meanwhile the graphic studio came up with the visual proposal for the main Gordic web. Even though it wasn't perfect at that time, I've proposed the idea, that I will consume the visual style. The rest of the project I've done directly in high fidelity.

                            When it comes to Czech legislative, you will find out that it is quite complicated. The section Laws, regulations, Czech accounting standards represent the real categorization. When important deadlines are coming, people start to look for detail information about the procedures. Because of that there was section with most searched articles to help you navigate through extensive content. Monitoring was the real customer needs so we provided summary of Legislative changes and option to set the alerting via email.

                                People in the accounting or in the law are stressed by the deadlines. If you miss it, you or your company can get expensive fine. My wife is accountant and I know it from my own experiences how hard job it is. I wanted to help them at least little bit. We provided the simple alerting. Every month you've received the digest of the updates and overview of the upcoming the deadlines to your email box.

                        <p>
                        I've enjoyed this project a lot and I got experiences from the area which I would probably never get. But I find out that I wanted to have bigger ownership, to discover new needs, and based on that adjust the product. I enjoyed a lot the autonomy and impact I had on the company. These factors drive my passion. This I didn't have in my full-time job and this project helped me to realize, that I need to find a different job.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p> I was proud that I managed to finish this support and learning portal faster than the graphic studio managed to finish the main Gordic web.
