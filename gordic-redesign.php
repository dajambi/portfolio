                            <h2>Outcome</h2>
                            <p>
                                In this project, I've prepared the new information architecture, over the hundreds of
                                wireframes for the main company website, and prepared the specification for visual
                                design which was handled by the Czech graphic & motion studio. Don't be surprised you
                                don't see the highly polished visuals, that wasn't my job. </p>
                            <p>
                                Besides that, I've come up with future concepts for the purchase process and online
                                product catalog. During the development phase, I was in touch with the developers to
                                provide guidance and design QA.

                                I can't tell you any specific numbers which would prove the impact on marketing metrics.
                                As the contractor, I didn't have long-term ownership. But the goal was to strengthen the
                                market position and send a message that Gordic is a software company with a wide product
                                portfolio. Later on, the Gordic was awarded as "Czech superbrand" for 2019 & 2020 which
                                is a good signal about improved Brand Awareness. I am proud and grateful that I was part
                                of this journey.

                        <p>
                            My friend who was in the Gordic security department ask me if I would be willing to help
                            them with the redesign. It sounded like a big challenge, so naturally, I had to say yes. I
                            mainly designed the wireframes, interactions, and user flows. But also later on I created
                            the visual design for emails and newsletters. Company was founded in 1993 as the software
                            company which developed information systems. But there were a few problems</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>General brand awareness that Gordic is the accounting company </li>
                            <li>Gordic is a supplier of information systems for public institutions.</li>
                            <li>People's often perception, due to historic circumstances is, that company that is doing
                                something for the public sector is a also fraudster.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>The main goals were</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Change the brand awareness</li>
                            <li>Increase Leads generation</li>
                            <li>Direct upsell of IS modules (like e-shop)</li>
                            <li>Selling training courses</li>

                        <h2>Assumptions or data?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Brand Awareness issue Gordic people felt on daily basis in many domains. They hired Czech
                            marketing agency H1.cz to run a workshop where they analyzed the problems. This workshop had
                            happened before my involvement and the outcome of the workshop served as the starting point
                            for my ideation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the beginning, We lacked the data from the existing web. I quickly implemented at least
                            Google Analytics and Hotjar to gather quantitative data and user interactions. We collected
                            the data for three months and I spotted two trends. The majority of visitors visited two
                            pages — Expert Training and Support center. People were looking for support articles and
                            best practices, but it wasn't available on the web. This fact convinced the leadership to
                            start a new project.

                            <a href="gordic-support.php" target="_blank" class="link odkaz anim-middleout">I am describing it in this
                                case study.</a>

                            Also, these two findings had an impact on the new information architecture and navigation
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've done simple research, where I discovered how the competitors (SAP, Stormwater, Vera,
                            ICZ) communicate with the customer and how their product portfolio is structured. Why?
                            Because then you can find a space for improvements and you’ll also see what you can do
                            differently.

                        <p>
                            Redesigning everything at once is always a bit dangerous and also kinda like a waterfall.
                            I've proposed to go further in small design weekly increments and create the quick concept.
                            Thanks to this lean approach, everyone had clear expectations. We've tested our
                            collaboration at the very beginning and I was able to deliver the design fast.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From the very beginning, I've focused on training courses. This had a huge revenue potential
                            and was one of the most visited pages. Part of that was also a concept for the product page
                            and homepage. After this main iteration, I've come up also with the concept for the system
                            configurator.

                        <h2>Homepage</h2>
                        <p>
                            The homepage is usually about attention and interest. The first section should say that
                            Gordic is a software company. Hence there was displayed the main digital product with a
                            strong message. that was emphasized by The social proof emphasized all of that, plus it
                            supported the credibility. The next section was about the product portfolio. I wanted to
                            stress out, that they don't develop only accounting software.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One potential risk was a bad brand perception. Because of that, the following section was
                            about the company, milestones, and values. There the visitor should find out, that they are
                            responsible and very transparent with a long history.
                            The last part was about the upcoming events. Surprisingly this was very important for the
                            customer relationship.

                                The goal was to provide information about the expert training. Customer needs a
                                different type of information in different stages of the customer journey. For
                                pre-booking phase, the page provided information about the training overview and how it
                                works(1). You can find info about the trainer(2) and sign up if there still was a free
                                spot. On the top of the page, there was availability indicator(3).
                            </p>
                            <p> The customer had also the option to set the reminder in case that the training hasn't
                                had any free capacity(4). After booking people needed to know, how to get to training
                                center, where to park the car (5). On the bottom I used the opportunity for cross-sell
                                (6).</p>

                            <p>
                                For booking, I designed a three-step process. In the first step user-added information
                                about one or more participants. Why more? Because the company usually sends two or three
                                people to join the training. The second step was about the invoice details. The last one
                                was the overview where the user still could make changes. After that, there was a
                                confirmation page where the user had the quick option to save the event into the
                                calendar. I also wanted to include online payment via card, but it would complicate the
                                internal invoice process. The company decided don't do that in the first version.

                            <p>
                                The Gordic products are quite complex. Product, belongs(1) to a specific sector. Each
                                product is composed of functional areas(2). Each functional area has several modules(3).
                                The challenge here was to provide easy navigation in the product structure.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The product detail page communicated the short product description, how the product
                                helps them and what are the benefits.
                                The part of the page was also the call to action where you could leave the contact. Then
                                the sales representative reached out to you. On the bottom, there was space for the
                                cross-selling of other modules. I've replicated this structure to all other product to
                                provide cohesive navigation pattern.

                        <h2>Online system configuration</span></h2>
                        <p>
                            The leaders had the vision to provide an online option for system configuration. In other
                            words, the Customer should have the ability to configure and buy a new system module online.
                            Similarly, as you can configure the car from your home. I used the lean approach and
                            designed the prototype that guided the user through the products. I've conducted guerrilla
                            testing with 3 people, who were working for the government and had experiences with similar
                            systems. And I tested it also with two other people from my network. </p>

                        <p>The outcome was, that people were able to go through the interactions and finish the process.
                            Also, they were quite confident that they finished the task. But the critical part was, <strong>that
                            participants needed to explicitly know what they should look for</strong>. And this mind model
                            doesn't correspond with real situations. Usually, the sales or implementation team works
                            closely with the customer to choose the correct module.
                            This idea was abandoned. In the future, there will be space to create a chatbot that will
                            guide customers through products or answer a customer questions.</p>

                        <p>Thanks to this exercise we discovered that the sales team need to find out the module based
                            on the search criteria. Because of that, the online catalog was developed later on.</p>

                            Communicate more and always ask if there is anything else that you should know about. It can
                            save a lot of hassle and time. In the middle of the project, I found out that the original
                            brand direction has been changed. It caused some clashes between the Brand designer, Graphic
                            studio, company stakeholders, and me.

                            Lead—People not always do what you expect from them. If you experience some problems that
                            you can solve for your client, just do it. Sure, some party of the project can be offended.
                            But your customer and their interest should be your priority, not compromises.

                        <p> This was a huge project that I did along with my full-time job. It was a great challenge,
                            but I found working 16 hours per day is not sustainable in the longterm and you can easily
                            burnout. It is fine to take one or two projects per year if you feel that you will enjoy it.
                            But remember that you are not a machine.
