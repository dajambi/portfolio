                                I've designed the new task management experience in MSP Manager. A user interface where
                                technicians or managers could see the task progress and where they can easily find what
                                needs to be done., anytime without asking anyone else.

                                This feature allows users to work faster and deliver results with high quality. Visual

                                matters. By creating a new template you can actually make the task flow reusable so any
                                other technician can benefit from your knowledge or improve the process. That fact
                                creates the loop of constant improvements.

                            The MSP Manager is the ticketing solution for IT technicians. There you find all the
                            information about the devices, what is the issue, and what you should do. Once you start
                            working, you can track your time, provide the notes and then generate the invoice for your
                            customer. You can do much more there, but this simple overview is just ok for this case
                            study. The feature I've designed was focused on the IT technicians who are working with this
                            product all day long.</p>

                        <p>
                            How can we speed up the ticket workflow? MSP technicians have to solve hundreds of tickets
                            each month. A lot of issue types are repeating or can be very similar. Some of them can be
                            very complex and the technician needs to cooperate on it with other IT colleagues. Then
                            knowing what to do can be challenging and you can find yourself spending more time on
                            finding what was done instead of solving customer issues. Of course, you have to meet the
                            SLA so you don't have the whole day for it.</p>

                        <p>
                            I've used the data from the design researchers and I've conducted interviews with the internal IT
                            technicians who were based in the same office. They usually do the multitasking and
                            relentlessly work their way through the ticket queue. They have two or more monitors in
                            order to be more efficient. They are communicating with their customers over email or phone.
                            Some of them are trying to organize and prioritize their work via Posti-ts or via a digital
                            task list. It is used repetitively or it is also shared with colleagues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What is the motivation? They are performance-driven. More solved tasks with high customer
                            satisfaction in the long term mean a chance to get a promotion. So they can meet their
                            aspiration and become the Technician manager. Their targets are billable time per week,
                            number of closed tickets, avg time to resolution, <span class="abbr"

                            Initially, we had a vision that we will build a robust system that will cover also IT
                            project management. But we didn't get the sponsors for this kind of project size. Therefore
                            we changed the scope and focus only for the task list.
                        </p>
                        <p>Based on the observation I've come up with the idea of reusable task templates. It means that
                            the task list for a specific type of work will be created only once and then can be used
                            many times. Or the template could be improved by more experienced colleagues. So MSP
                            provider would be able to constantly improve the procedure, share the best practices and
                            improve the service quality.</p>

                            When you set task status as the done, a system created a new event in the time log. If you wanted to change ticket status as done, the system checked whether there is any remaining task and gives you a notification if that was true. You don't want to say to the customer that the issue is solved when some task hasn't been done yet. Are you more interested in details? See the mockups below.

                            We haven't tested this solution with the customers. Long story short, we didn't have enough time and personal capacity for it. But I've done at least the guerilla testing with the same group of local IT technicians as I used for the research part. They were positively surprised that we've been thinking about the templates. People are happy when someone listening to their needs. From the testing came up one idea—visualize the task dependency as you often need to wait for someone or for something.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            We used the beta user group to validate the feature before it was released to everyone. The disadvantage of this approach is that you need to develop the solution. It can happen that the proposed solution won't solve the problem, but this wasn't the case.  The feedback from the beta user groups was great. The development team tweaked a few bugs and performance issues and after three months it was publicly released.

                        I didn't have a chance to conduct the deep discovery research and we didn't even have any analytics. It meant that the whole team was doing the decisions based on assumptions. Our PM had a deep knowledge of the customer needs, but it isn't an ideal practice to rely on the opinions of one person.

                        </p>

                        <p> When it came to the user testing it was the same story. I didn't agree with this approach at all, but sometimes you need to adapt to be able to deliver the design for your team.
