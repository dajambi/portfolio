This is where I bring the most value, leveraging my generalist approach and diverse skillset. I also find joy in tackling complex products powered by GenAI – especially when the team understands the transformative potential of their work and upholds ethical principles and safeguards.

                        <p>Design has always been my passion. As a kid, I installed Photoshop for the first time and created my very first website — a single paragraph with three buttons 👏. That small project marked the beginning of an incredible design journey.</p>

                        <p>As a teenager, I designed and coded a <a data-img="img/about/bside.png" data-fx="12">gaming portal</a> for myself and my gaming crew. which kicked off my passion for design and brought me my first clients. These early projects gave me creative and financial <a data-img="img/about/freedom.gif" data-fx="12">freedom.</a></p>

                        <p> While studying at university, I discovered how design could seamlessly blend with business and project management. This realization fueled my freelancing career, during which I designed hundreds

                            , car wraps, book covers, email campaigns, and business cards. I took every challenge as an opportunity to learn, teaching myself new skills and delivering on client needs.

                        <p>
                        One of my most rewarding experiences was helping my mother start <a href="https://www.kosmetika-jamborova.cz/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">her business.</a> I didn’t just create a marketing website, but I crafted the customer experience that endures till now. This kicked off my passion for a holistic approach and transition into UX / product design, focusing on apps and information systems.

                        <p>As an independent designer, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with inspiring companies and individuals. I contributed to <a href="https://www.gordic.cz/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Gordic.cz</a> by designing their support portal and reimagining their web ecosystem. I designed and developed <a href="https://www.emontana.cz/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">emontana.cz</a>, a popular climbing portal in the Czech Republic. For <a href="https://www.ntsup.eu/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">ntsup.cz</a>, I refreshed their branding and created offline campaigns seen across the Czechia.
                        </p>

                        <p>I’ve had the privilege of designing complex SaaS applications for  <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">SolarWinds</a> /  <a href="https://www.n-able.com/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">N-able</a>, where I was part of the MSP design team.

                         N-able is a global leader in MSP software, and I’m proud to have contributed to their success.

                        <p>Later, I joined the Czech travel startup <a href="https://www.kiwi.com" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Kiwi.com</a>, where I led the design of an internal Helpdesk application. Together, we transformed the chaotic support experience during the 2020 COVID pandemic into a proactive and reliable service.

                        At <a href="https://www.outreach.io/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Outreach.io</a>, I helped shape the future of sales with projects like <a href="https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/7989565935643-Sales-Execution-Report-Overview" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Sales Execution Report</a> and innovative GenAI-powered features like <a href="https://www.outreach.io/resources/blog/smart-email-assist-public-beta" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Smart Email Assist</a>, <a href="https://www.outreach.io/resources/blog/smart-account-plans" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Account Plans</a>, and Prospecting Agent—pioneering disruption in the sales domain.

                        I’ve also ventured into entrepreneurship as the co-founder of <a href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/story-about-mentedy-my-startup-odyssey-173c9bef7aba" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Mentedy</a>, a mentoring platform that almost reached its full potential. Today, I channel that same drive into my second startup, <a href="https://lucanto.eu/" target="_blank" class="link odkaz">Lucanto.eu</a>, an accounting and payment platform for SMBs powered by GenAI. It’s a rewarding, terrifying, and exhausting experience, usually all at once.

                        <p>That’s my story. Now let’s dive into yours, shall we?</p>

                                    <p>Design is everything - and it is true. Design goes beyond nice pixels and aesthetics. It's about how every element of a product or service works together to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for the customer. From service to support, sales to marketing, every touchpoint must be carefully crafted to ensure a cohesive and engaging user journey. In today's highly competitive market, good design is no longer optional. It's what sets apart successful products and services and drives long-term success. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>However, good design is not just about the big picture. It's also about the details - the little things that may be unnoticed, but can make a significant difference in the overall experience. Without attention to detail, even the best-designed product or service may fall short of its potential. Therefore, it's crucial to give design and customer experience a central place in your company's structure – if you want to create product your customer will love.</p>

                                    <p>Everything I've achieved in sport, school, job or life was thanks to hard work,
                                        endurance and a positive approach and it didn't happen over the night. I like a
                                        famous quote from Arnold Schwarzenegger „If you don't find the time, if you
                                        don't do the work, you don't get the results." — this streams through my veins
                                        and I believe
                                        that it is reflected in my work.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>The feedback is the best thing you can get even though it is hard to accept it
                                        sometimes. But it is the only way how to move forward. Basically it is a simple
                                        formula — pain + reflection + open mind = progress. The same way works the
                                        design process and the same way I use this principle for my personal
                                        development.</p>

                                    <p>I really do respect people and I believe in open communication culture. I did a
                                        few mistakes in the past when I was quiet and followed the crowd, but I will not
                                        repeat it. So now when I don't like something I say it, when I see space for
                                        improvements I say it even if you will be the highest-paid person in the room.

                                    <p>I love working in a startup mode. The mode where people are doing their best, where everyone goes far beyond their own responsibilities, and when you can grab the beer and enjoy a nice moment with the team. I am enjoying very diverse projects. The projects where I can collaborate or handle the research, design, validation, motion, or help with the design system and principles. Thanks to my side project I also found a passion in front-end, product/project management, and go-to-market activities.</p>

                        <p>Adventures, adrenaline sports, and traveling are the activities that bring joy to my life and recharge my energy. I feel truly alive when I’m immersed in nature, with sea salt in my hair and sunsets melting into ocean horizons. The best moments of my life haven’t been spent in front of a monitor—they’ve been created when I stepped out of my comfort zone, conquered mountains, and shared breathtaking views with my adventure companions. I’ve realized that people regret the things they didn’t do, not the things they tried. That’s why I embrace saying yes to new challenges.</p>

                        <p>Life without family, supportive friends, and great colleagues would be far too lonely. In the past, I often isolated myself, focusing solely on completing work for clients or rushing to deliver new features. Now, I’ve come to understand what truly matters. I’ve learned to say no to side projects unless they’re truly meaningful, and I prioritize spending time with my family, friends, or pursuing personal growth. These moments hold far greater value.</p>
